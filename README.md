#### Possible errors on IOS first run
CodellitCalendar is using `react-native-vector-icons` library as icons provider.
Its link (fonts file) may cause a error when app runs on ios first time.

## A message for the Code Reviewers

- You will notice that throughout the project I used constant values â€‹â€‹for the width and height of some components. The idea was to provide more performance for the lists. With these constants, this task is simplified.

- At some points in the project, I left some comments about what I would have done in a real use case but I chose not to include it in this challenge because I believe this is not the focus.

- Context API + Redux: Although I chose to use React's Context API, all state management was created using Redux exclusively. The role of the Contex API is to abstract the available actions of the App into a context. This is to avoid repeating rules across components.

- Responsive layout:
With React Native and its eco system, we have a few ways to provide a nice layout for users regardless of their device. I used React Native's own API in this challenge: PixelRatio.

- Summary Comments: In some functions, I used sumarry comments. It's a practice that I really like and that, due to time, I couldn't spread it throughout the app. So I left some just for example.
